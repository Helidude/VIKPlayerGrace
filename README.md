I made my first plugin. Its called PlayerGrace. 
On our server we run `!identity purge 14` every restart, clearing grids from non active players. 
But sometimes people stays away for a prolonged periode of time and ask us to save their grids. 
This problem is now solved easily with this plugin!
Just select the player and type the number of days to add the players grace period.

When the the time is up, or you remove the player mnaually, he is staying for the number of days you got in the identity purge command. 

I'm was learning c# and WPF while i made this plugin, so there will most likely be bugs. 
If you encounter any problems, just leave me a message. 
When i learn to use GIT I'll upload the plugin on github. 

Cheers!
